## Data Collection
To analyze the 2023/24 English Premier League season, I gathered extensive and precise data from the official website of the [English Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/stats) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_Premier_League). These sources offered detailed information on matches, player performances, managers, captains, and stadia. The data collection process involved thorough gathering, cross-referencing, cleaning, and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency. This robust dataset allowed for an in-depth exploration of the season's intricacies, uncovering fascinating insights and trends that vividly captured the excitement and drama of the most watched league in the world.

## Data Preparation
Transforming raw data into valuable insights began with meticulous preparation. Using Microsoft Excel, I organized the data into structured formats before importing it into Power BI for visualization. This process involved several key steps:
1. Cleaning: I removed duplicates and blanks, addressed missing values, and ensured all data was formatted in tables.
2. Ensuring Integrity: I eliminated blank rows and duplicates using Excel’s filter function. I also cross-checked team names and details against official competition websites to correct any errors.
3. Aggregation: I compiled statistics at various levels, such as team and player stats, to facilitate easy and comprehensive analysis.

## Data Visualization
To unlock the story within the data, I crafted six compelling dashboards using Power BI, making the information both engaging and accessible. These interactive dashboards comprehensively covered various aspects of the season, revealing team and player performances, significant highlights, and detailed metrics such as goals, assists, shots, clean sheets, and bookings. Dedicated sections allow fans to track their favorite team’s performance easily, providing a dynamic and thorough visualization of the season’s events.
